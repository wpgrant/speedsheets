# Docker

## Summary
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.
(Definition from Wikipedia)

## Tools
* <b>Docker Compose</> is a tool for defining multi-container Docker applications.
* <b>Docker Swarm</> provides clustering for Docker, by turning a group of Docker engines into a single engine.

## Installation
<l>https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/</>

## Concepts

### Images
An image is a template for creating containers. Images can be based on other images. Images are created with Dockerfiles that define how the image is created and run.

### Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image. Containers can be created, started, stopped, moved and deleted. A container can be connected with other containers or the host; by default it is reasonably isolated.

## Getting started
This is the hello world of Docker
<cb>$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash</>
Such a small command accomplishes a lot
* If the ubuntu image hasn't already been downloaded, it is downloaded now
* A new container is run
* Docker gives the container a read/write filesystem
* An IP address is assigned to the container, providing access from the host
* A shell is open inside the container, so additional commands can be run
* Upon exiting, the shell is closed and container is shutdown (but not deleted)

## Commands

### Commands for Images

#### docker images
Get a list of all images
<cb>
$ docker images
REPOSITORY      TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
python-docker   latest            8cae92a8fbd6   3 minutes ago   123MB
python          3.8-slim-buster   be5d294735c6   9 days ago      113MB
</>

#### docker images [Repository[:TAG]]
Get a list of images by repository or repository+tag. Matches must be exact.
<cb>
$ docker images java
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
java                8                   308e519aac60        6 days ago          824.5 MB
java                7                   493d82594c15        3 months ago        656.3 MB
java                latest              2711b1d6f3aa        5 months ago        603.9 MB

$ docker images java:8
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
java                8                   308e519aac60        6 days ago          824.5 MB
</>

#### docker images --filter (or -f)
Get a list based on one or more filters. (Each filter requires --filter/-f before it).

Examples of filters
* dangling=true
* label (label=\<key> or label=\<key>=\<value>)
* before (\<image-name>[:<tag>], \<image id> or \<image@digest>)
* since (<image-name>[:\<tag>], \<image id> or \<image@digest>)
reference (pattern of an image reference)

#### docker rmi \<image>
Remove (and un-tag) an image.
